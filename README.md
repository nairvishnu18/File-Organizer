## Welcome to File Organizer

Here's a small project which I started in order to explore Python Programming language and learn about it. 
This is a miniature File Organizer Application which will ease your task of organizing files into corresponding folders based on their file type.
It also provides a feature of removing junk files which you might see in some folders and helps in detecting duplicates as well.

Firstly, we don't need many packgaes for building this. We only need the following packages.

1. Tkinter
2. os
3. shutil
```
